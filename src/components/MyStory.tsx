            The vision to help women discover who they are was planted in my heart in 2008.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But life happened.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Responsibilities, expectations, and challenges slowly pulled me away from myself. I looked accomplished on the outside, yet inside I felt disconnected, unfulfilled, and unsure of who I truly was.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Through lived experiences, faith, and intentional realignment, I found my way back to clarity and identity.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Along that journey, women kept coming to me informally. They shared their confusion, their marriages, their transitions, their questions. And clarity followed our conversations.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In 2024, I fully aligned with this calling.
          </p>

            Today, I don't help women from theory or textbooks.
          </p>

            I guide them from lived experience, spiritual alignment, and proven clarity framework.
